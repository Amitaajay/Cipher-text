# Cipher-text
Ciphering is a mechanism of encoding a message in order to obscure its meaning to  unintended readers. One simple way of achieving this is by offsetting each character in the  message by a certain number of letters. 
For example, say the offset is 3. The word LOL would be encoded to become ORO. Each  letter has been “pushed” forward by 3 positions going by the classic alphabet order. If at the  end of the alphabet, the mechanism loops around back to the beginning of the alphabet. So  the word ZOO would become CRR. 
Write a program that, given an encoded message and an offset, would produce the original  message. 
 1. The code is implemented in python
